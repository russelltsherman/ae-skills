# Using the Argo Workflows CLI

This skill covers operating Argo Workflows from the `argo` CLI — submitting runs,
reading output, debugging failures, managing the workflow lifecycle, authoring
templates, and scheduling cron jobs. The goal is safe, observable workflow
operations: you know what ran, why it failed, and how to recover. Command-group
detail lives in the `references/` files below; this body routes you to the right
one and captures conventions that apply everywhere.

## Prerequisite check — confirm `argo` is available

Before any `argo` command, verify the binary is reachable:

```bash
argo version
```

If this fails (command not found, connection refused, permission denied, or any
other error): **STOP. Surface the exact command and the exact error output.
Do not attempt workarounds, alternate tools, or kubectl substitutes.** The
binary must be installed and the Kubernetes context must be reachable before
proceeding. Common reasons this fails:

- `argo` is not installed or not on `$PATH` — install the CLI matching your
  server version from the Argo Workflows GitHub releases page.
- No valid kubeconfig / wrong context — run `kubectl cluster-info` to confirm
  the cluster is reachable.
- Argo server not deployed in the target namespace — confirm with
  `kubectl -n argo get deploy workflow-controller`.

Only continue once `argo version` exits cleanly.

## Decision routing

Use the section that matches your task, then read the linked reference file for
detailed command syntax, flags, and examples.

### Submitting, linting, and monitoring workflows

You want to submit a workflow spec, dry-run it, pass parameters, or observe a
running workflow (list, get status, stream logs, watch live).

→ Read [`references/submission-and-monitoring.md`](references/submission-and-monitoring.md)

Covers: `submit`, `lint`, `list`, `get`, `logs`, `watch`, `@latest` shorthand,
parameter overrides, `--from` (reuse a template), container selection.

### Debugging failures and lifecycle operations

A workflow step has failed, is stuck, or you need to act on a running/completed
workflow (stop it, retry from a failed node, resubmit from scratch, suspend,
resume, or clean it up).

→ Read [`references/debugging-and-lifecycle.md`](references/debugging-and-lifecycle.md)

Covers: debugging escalation path (`argo get` → `argo logs` → `kubectl describe`
pod), common failure causes, `retry`, `resubmit`, `stop`, `terminate`, `suspend`,
`resume`, `delete`.

### Authoring workflow specs and templates

You are writing or reviewing a workflow spec: choosing DAG vs Steps, composing
WorkflowTemplates, wiring parameters and artifacts, setting retry strategy /
backoff, or tuning resource requests and parallelism.

→ Read [`references/authoring.md`](references/authoring.md)

Covers: DAG vs Steps decision criteria, WorkflowTemplate / ClusterWorkflowTemplate
/ `templateRef`, parameter and variable patterns, artifact configuration (key
parameterization, `.tgz` suffix, GC), retry strategy with exponential backoff,
resource management (requests/limits, nodeSelector, tolerations, parallelism,
synchronization).

### Cron workflows

You are creating, listing, suspending, resuming, or deleting a CronWorkflow, or
you need to understand concurrency policy and timezone handling.

→ Read [`references/cron-workflows.md`](references/cron-workflows.md)

Covers: `cron create`, `cron list`, `cron suspend`, `cron resume`, `cron delete`,
`cron lint`, concurrency policy (`Allow` / `Forbid` / `Replace`), timezone.

## Cross-cutting conventions

- **Namespace flag.** Most `argo` commands default to the `argo` namespace; pass
  `-n <namespace>` when workflows live elsewhere. Set `ARGO_NAMESPACE` in your
  environment to avoid repeating it.
- **`@latest` shorthand.** In `get`, `logs`, `watch`, `retry`, and `resubmit`,
  `@latest` refers to the most-recently submitted workflow in the namespace — saves
  copying the generated name during development.
- **Dry-run before submit.** `argo lint <file>` validates the spec client-side
  without touching the cluster. Use it in CI and before every first submit of a
  new template.
- **Output formats.** Add `-o json` or `-o yaml` to `argo get` and `argo list` for
  machine-readable output (useful for scripting and debugging).
