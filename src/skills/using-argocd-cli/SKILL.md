# Using the Argo CD CLI

Operate Argo CD declaratively from the `argocd` CLI. Argo CD is a GitOps controller:
**Git is the source of truth**, and the CLI's job is to inspect, reconcile, and
occasionally override the relationship between desired state (Git) and live state
(the cluster). Sections below run simple → complex; jump to the one you need and follow
its `references/` pointer for deep material.

## Authentication & Context

Authenticate before anything else. Two audiences: an interactive developer wanting a
persisted session, or CI/CD automation driven entirely by environment variables.

```bash
# Interactive (human at a terminal)
argocd login argocd.example.com --sso
argocd context argocd.stg.example.com   # switch between saved servers

# Automation (no prompt, no disk session)
export ARGOCD_SERVER=argocd.example.com
export ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN=<project-scoped-token>
export ARGOCD_OPTS="--grpc-web"   # global flags applied to every call
argocd app list
```

**Prefer project-scoped API token auth over username/password for any non-interactive
or shared use.** Passwords are long-lived and broadly privileged; project role tokens are
scoped and revocable. `--grpc-web` is usually required behind an ingress; `--core` talks
straight to the Kubernetes API and skips the Argo CD API server.

For token vs password tradeoffs, `ARGOCD_*` env vars, `--grpc-web`/`--core`, role tokens,
and the interactive-vs-CI contrast, see `references/authentication.md`.

## Application Lifecycle

The core loop: create an app, review the diff, sync it, wait for health, and eventually
delete it. This covers the full create → sync → monitor → delete path.

```bash
# Create
argocd app create payments-prod \
  --repo https://github.com/acme/payments-manifests.git \
  --path overlays/prod \
  --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc \
  --dest-namespace payments \
  --project payments

# Inspect & review before changing the cluster
argocd app get payments-prod          # status, health, sync state
argocd app diff payments-prod         # desired (Git) vs live (cluster)

# Apply desired state, then block until it settles
argocd app sync payments-prod
argocd app wait payments-prod --health --timeout 300

# Tear down (removes the app and, by default, its managed resources)
argocd app delete payments-prod
```

`get` and `diff` are read-only — run them before every `sync` in production so you know
exactly what will change. `wait --health` turns a fire-and-forget sync into a gated step
suitable for a pipeline.

## Sync Strategies

How desired state reaches the cluster: manually (a human gate) or automatically (applied
on drift). Tune with `--self-heal`, `--auto-prune`, `--dry-run`, sync waves, hooks, and a
retry policy.

```bash
argocd app sync payments-stg --dry-run                # preview, no changes
argocd app set payments-stg --sync-policy automated   # auto-apply on drift
argocd app set payments-stg --self-heal --auto-prune  # enforce + clean up
```

**Use manual sync for production; reserve automated sync for lower environments.**
Production should keep a deliberate promotion gate rather than auto-applying every merge.

For manual vs automated detail, `--self-heal`/`--auto-prune`, dry-run, sync waves, hooks,
`--force`/`--prune` cautions, `--apply-out-of-sync-only`, and retry policy, see
`references/sync-strategies.md`.

## Health Monitoring

After syncing, confirm the app is actually healthy — `Synced` (desired == live) is not the
same as `Healthy` (workloads running correctly).

```bash
argocd app get payments-prod              # Sync Status + Health Status at a glance
argocd app resources payments-prod        # per-resource health breakdown
argocd app wait payments-prod --health    # block until Healthy (or timeout)
argocd app list -o wide                   # fleet-wide health overview
```

Treat `Degraded` or stuck `Progressing` as the signal to drill in (see Troubleshooting).
When deep diagnosis is needed — events, logs, manifest compare, hard refresh — jump to
`references/troubleshooting.md`.

## Rollbacks

When a deploy goes bad, you can roll the live cluster back to a previous synced
revision — but that does not change Git.

```bash
argocd app history payments-prod              # find a known-good history id
argocd app rollback payments-prod <id>        # emergency: roll live back NOW
# then fix Git so the bad revision can't return:
git revert <bad-sha> && git push
argocd app sync payments-prod
```

**Prefer a Git revert over `argocd app rollback`.** A `rollback` changes only live state
and **auto-disables automated sync**; Git still points at the bad revision, so the next
sync re-applies it. Use `rollback` as a stopgap and always follow with a Git revert.

For the emergency procedure, the auto-disable behavior, `app history`, and the required
Git follow-up, see `references/rollback-procedures.md`.

## App-of-Apps

The app-of-apps pattern is a single parent Application whose rendered manifests are
*themselves* child Applications — a way to bootstrap and manage a fixed set of apps from
one Git path.

```bash
argocd app create platform-bootstrap \
  --repo https://github.com/acme/platform.git \
  --path apps \
  --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc \
  --dest-namespace argocd
argocd app sync platform-bootstrap   # creates/updates all child apps
```

Use app-of-apps for a small, hand-curated, mostly static set. Once you are templating the
same app across many environments or clusters, graduate to an ApplicationSet — the
threshold and tradeoffs are in `references/applicationset-generators.md`.

## ApplicationSets

An ApplicationSet templates many Applications from generators (List, Git, Cluster,
Matrix), adding and removing apps automatically as clusters register or Git directories
appear.

```bash
argocd appset list
argocd appset get payments-fleet
argocd appset create applicationset.yaml   # apply an ApplicationSet manifest
```

By default, removing a generated entry deletes its Application and live resources; set
`preserveResourcesOnDeletion: true` to keep workloads running when an entry leaves the
set.

For Git/Cluster/Matrix/List generators, the app-of-apps → ApplicationSet transition
thresholds, and `preserveResourcesOnDeletion`, see
`references/applicationset-generators.md`.

## RBAC & Projects

AppProjects scope which repos, destinations, and resource kinds an app may use; RBAC
controls who may act on apps. Argo CD's default is deny-all.

```bash
argocd proj list
argocd proj create payments \
  --src https://github.com/acme/payments-manifests.git \
  --dest https://kubernetes.default.svc,payments-*
argocd proj role create-token payments ci --expires-in 720h
argocd admin settings rbac can role:payments-deployer sync 'payments/web'
```

Grant least privilege explicitly and never set a permissive default. For AppProjects,
project-scoped role tokens, `rbac validate`/`rbac can`, SSO group mapping, and the
deny-all default, see `references/rbac-configuration.md`.

## Multi-Cluster

Argo CD can deploy from one control plane to many target clusters. Register a cluster
once, then target it from an app's destination.

```bash
argocd cluster add <kube-context>      # register a cluster (uses your kubeconfig context)
argocd cluster list                    # registered clusters + connection status
# target a registered cluster by server URL in app create:
argocd app create web-eu \
  --dest-server https://eu.k8s.example.com \
  --dest-namespace web --repo ... --path ...
```

Registered clusters become the input to the Cluster and Matrix ApplicationSet generators
(`references/applicationset-generators.md`) for fanning one app across the whole fleet.

## Troubleshooting

When an app is stuck, `OutOfSync` for unclear reasons, or `Degraded`, work a fixed flow:
`app get` → `app resources` → events/logs → `terminate-op`.

```bash
argocd app get payments-prod              # 1. localize: sync + health + last op
argocd app resources payments-prod        # 2. find the one bad resource
argocd app diff payments-prod             # compare live vs Git when OutOfSync
argocd app get payments-prod --hard-refresh   # clear cache if Git changed but app didn't
argocd app terminate-op payments-prod     # cancel a wedged sync operation
```

If an app renders `Unknown`/`Missing`, check repo connectivity (`argocd repo list`)
before debugging manifests. For the full diagnostic flowchart, manifest live-vs-git
compare, hard refresh, and repo checks, see `references/troubleshooting.md`.
